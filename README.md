# Common Neighbor Analysis (CNA) Library  

**CNA** is a Python library for Common Neighbor Analysis. The core implementation is in `CNA.py`.  

## Structure

- `CNA.py` – Main analysis code.
- `Graphs/` – Classes for drawing different types of graphs.
- `old/` – some code from **pySNOW**. (should be removed and replaced with a submodule or similar)
- `examples/` – some specific examples showcasing the functionalities of the library
- `crystal_maker.py` - some code to create periodic lattices.

## Dependencies

- `matplotlib`  
- `numpy`  

## Usage

Import and use the functions in `CNA.py` for common neighbor analysis.
